# Learning Java

# Comments

* Java is compiled from code that humans can read and write into code the
  computer can run
* Comments let you leave notes inside the code that are ignored by the compiler

* You can comment a single line starting with `//`

```java
// this is ignored
```

* Or you can comment several lines by surrounding them with `/*` and `*/`

```java
/*
  This is
  a longer
  comment
*/
```

# Blocks of code

All blocks of code in Java are delimited by curly braces

## { ...code goes here... }

_On your keyboard, the curly braces are located in the upper right, above the
square brackets._

---

# Classes

 Classes are the top-most block of code

```java
class YourClass {

   // ...code goes here...

}
```

_Technically there's other top-level block types, but we'll explore them later._

# Case sensitive

Java is case sensitive, so be sure to match uppercase and lowercase letters
exactly.

.panel[
YourClass
]

**is not the same as**

.panel[
YOURclass
]
