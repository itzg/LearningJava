# Welcome to Java

You're about to learn the programming language Java.

Java is a fun and rewarding language to learn.

Many things are implemented in Java, like...
* Minecraft
* Web servers
* Mobile apps
* any many more

Once you master Java you'll find it becomes easier to learn even more languages.

# Comments

* Java is compiled from code that humans can read and write into code the
  computer can run
* Comments let you leave notes inside the code that are ignored by the compiler

* You can comment a single line starting with `//`

```java
// this is ignored
```

* Or you can comment several lines by surrounding them with `/*` and `*/`

```java
/*
  This is
  a longer
  comment
 */
```

# Blocks of code

All blocks of code in Java are delimited by curly braces

## { ...code goes here... }

_On your keyboard, the curly braces are located in the upper right, above the
square brackets. Hold down the "Shift" key when pressing the square bracket key._

---

# Classes

 Classes are the top-most block of code

```java
class YourClass {

   // ...code goes here...

}
```

_Technically there's other top-level block types, but we'll explore them later._

---
# Case sensitive

Java is case sensitive, so be sure to match uppercase and lowercase letters
exactly.

.panel[
YourClass
]

**is not the same as**

.panel[
YOURclass
]

---
# Camel case

A common practice (also called a "convention") in Java is to use
what's called "camel case" to join the words that make up the names of things.

_By the way, in Java, "identifiers" means the "name of a thing"._

.panel[ThisSentenceCanBeTheNameOfAClass]

It's called camel case because the uppercase letters starting each word
make the sentence look like it has humps like a camel.

For now, there's one more rule with Java identifiers:
* Names of **classes** start with an **uppercase** letter
* Other identifiers, like **fields, methods, and variables** start with a **lowercase** letter

.panel[andThisWouldBeSomethingElse]

# What are fields, methods, and variables

Stay tuned...we'll talk about them in just a minute.

---
# Primitive types

Java comes with some basic (or "primitive") data types. Here's a few of the
most handy and common ones:

### int
A positive or negative whole number, or **int**-eger, like 0, 1, 42, -4, ...

### float
A **float**-ing-point number that has a decimal point, like 3.14, 0.7, -987.2

### boolean
A value that indicates truthi-ness, either **`true`** or **`false`**

---
# Fields

Let's get back to classes. **Java classes are like recipes** to define instances of things.

Part of the class' recipe is declaring what pieces of data it can hold,
which are called **fields**

A field looks like
.panel[type name;]

For example:
```java
class Animal {
*  int eyes;
}
```

The way read to the class declaration (or its recipe) above is

.panel[An `Animal` **has** a field named `eyes` that **is** an `int`"]

---
# Semicolons  ;

The field `eyes`, declared below must end with a semicolon (;).

Semicolons are our way to tell the compiler where the end is. _It's like a period at the end of a sentence...but
period gets used for something else in Java._

```java
class Animal {
*  int eyes;
}
```

Make sure you're using a semicolon and **not colon (:)**. Colons have other
uses in Java that we'll see later.

On your keyboard, the semicolon is on the right, just next to the comma. In
fact, you can remember a semicolon because it has a comma on the bottom part
and it's "partly like" a colon.

---
# Default values

Back to fields, a field declaration can be given a default value.

We can probably assume most animals have two eyes, so let's declare a **default**
to avoid having to type and set that value for every animal we create:

```java
class Animal {
  int eyes = 2;
}
```

So, as you can see, the extended field declaration syntax is:
.panel[type name = value;]

Actually, the field automatically had a default value of zero before. Every
type in Java comes with its own default:
* numbers are zero
* booleans are `false`
* and objects are `null`. _I'll explain objects and null later._

---
# More class fields

Let's give our animal some more fields, each with a different type:

```java
class Animal {
  int eyes = 2;
  float age; // the default of zero works
  boolean breathsAir = true;
}
```

---
# An object is an instance of a class

Like a recipe, a class on its own doesn't really do anything.

To create a new object from a class, we use the **`new`** operator:

.panel[new ClassToCreate();]

Such as:
```java
new Animal();
```

That statement creates a brand new object **of type** `Animal` with all of
its fields set to the default values we declared:
* Two eyes
* An age of zero
* And it breaths air

---
# Variables

In the last slide, we created an animal, but we didn't capture it.

```java
new Animal(); // but it got away
```

To actually keep the object and do something with it, we need to save it
in a **variable**.

Variables are declared a lot like fields:
.panel[type name = initialValue;]

So, to capture an `Animal` object we can use:
```java
Animal mysteryAnimal = new Animal();
```
